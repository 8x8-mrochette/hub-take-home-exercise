# Application to Fuze's hub team

Welcome to the hub team's take home exercise repository! We hope that this will help you get your exercise started on the right track. Your submission will help us understand you as a developer and will help shape the conversation in your interview with your potential manager.

We're not expecting you to solve world hunger, and we understand that you can't spend a month doing this.

## Getting started

First things first, you'll want to clone this repository onto your machine and create a branch off of the exercise branch which you were assigned. Please name your new branch using your name.
